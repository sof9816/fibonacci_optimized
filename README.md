# Fibonacci Optimized ðŸŽ¯

Some computations are naturally time-consuming and have very little room for optimization, such as the Fibonacci sequence; knowing this, the standard way of doing things in Flutter can be slow and jittery as everything is being processed in an event loop.

## What has been done ðŸ˜„

- A single page app that has counter and a fibonacci value of that counter.âœ…
- **Bloc** was used in the projectâœ…
- Using an **optimized** function to calculate the **fibonacci** with loops.âœ…
- Making the function work in background using **Isolate** and **compute** function. âœ…
- Adding loading indicator for the function in the UI.âœ…
- Table of the data that is going through the process was maintained in a map with a status of the **fibonacci** background operation. âœ…

âž• Plus:

- Adding CI for the project using github actions.âœ…
